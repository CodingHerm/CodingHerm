  <p>When talking about C++, I understand how to code with it and make basic things. But I also code frequently using C++ blueprints in Ue4. Since I do this, I have a deeper understanding of C++ even if I can't code it. That is why I put C++ at the score of 60 instead of lower.</p>

  <p3>Game Development Projects</p3>
  <div style ="width:50%">

  <p>I love doing game development and it is one of my favorite hobbies. I have lots of different projects, but none are currently finished. Most of those projects were me messing 
    around and making something. For instance I have created a bow and arrow project in Ue4 where I just made a bow and arrow system. 
    With game development I have also forced myself to learn how to 3D model. I do not enjoy 3D modeling, and I am also not very great at it, but I can get the job done with 
    decent results.</p>

  <p3>C++ Projects</p3>
    <div style ="width:50%">
    <p>I have quite a few C++ projects were I was just messing around and making something I thought was cool or useful. For example, I made a calculator for complex math
      in 8th grade so that I could check my answers.

  <p2>Work Experience</p2>
  <div style ="width:50%">
  <p>I have worked on my dad's farm for a long time. While working I have done various 
    jobs such as:</p>
    <p><ul style="font-size:25px;"> 
      <li>Driving a tractor with a mower implement on the back</li>
      <li>Driving a four wheeler with a sprayer on the back </li>
      <li>Going into the fields and pulling/cutting rye.</li>
    </ul></p>

     <hr style="background-color: white; width: 50%">
     <p>Doing these things over the summer and during school have taught me the importance 
      of various aspects of working. They have improved my time management skills and work ethic.</p>

  <p2>Passions</p2>
  <p>I love playing the piano and computer science. I have been playing the piano for a very long time and I have been doing computer science since I was little.</p>
  <p2>Me</p2>
  <hr style="background-color: white;width: 50%">
  <p>I have been learning every since I was little and really enjoy it. I have taught myself lots  of things from how to make games to how to make brownies. I believe that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is the true church and I have a strong testimony of it. My computer science journey started when I was a kid and was using scratch. Later I found Unity and used it before switching to Unreal Engine. I have been using Unreal Engine for a while somewhat consistently and enjoy making games in it. I have been playing the piano since I was about four years old. I have learned various pieces such as Moonlight Sonatas 3rd movement and I am currently working on learning Grandes Ã©tudes de Paganini, S.141 - No. 6 in A Minor  "Theme and Variations".</p>
